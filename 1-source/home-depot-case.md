## Introduction

By 2024, The Home Depot had become one of the most sophisticated digital retailers in the world. What began years earlier as a push to modernize IT systems had evolved into a large-scale digital product organization, supporting everything from supply chain optimization and workforce enablement to personalized customer experiences and AI-driven decision support. Digital products were no longer confined to the website or mobile app, they shaped how associates worked on the floor, how inventory moved through the network, how customers planned projects, and how decisions were made across critical lines of business. At the center of this transformation was a belief that empowered digital product teams were the best way to innovate at speed.

Yet as Home Depot's digital footprint expanded, a new problem began to surface – one that was becoming increasingly visible to senior leadership. Despite individual teams delivering new, innovative digital products and AI-enabled services that were improving performance within respective business units, there was growing friction across the enterprise as a whole. Digital capabilities that were each successful in isolation were starting to collide. As such, the concern was not that digital product teams were underperforming, but that the cumulative effect of these locally optimized capabilities was eroding enterprise coherence.

At the core of the company's vision for digital transformation was a deliberate belief that enhancements to capabilities, systems, and decision processes should operate as a connected, intelligible whole, rather than as a collection of high-performing but loosely coupled parts—so that customers would experience consistency across channels, employees would understand how their work fit into broader priorities, and leaders could make decisions with confidence that actions taken in one area would not unintentionally undermine outcomes elsewhere. However, for senior leaders it was imperative that enterprise coherence not imply uniformity or centralization; rather, it needs to reflect dynamic and continuous alignment across strategy, architecture, governance, and execution such that local action contributes to system-level performance. They also recognized that enterprise coherence becomes increasingly critical as digital and AI-enabled capabilities scale, because the effects of misalignment are no longer contained within individual business units but propagate across the organization resulting in increasing hidden costs, and new operational and reputational risks that were difficult to see—or manage—through traditional governance mechanisms.

## The December 2025 Leadership Meeting

In December 2025, during the last Senior Leadership Team meeting of the year, the issue of growing friction with one of Home Depot's most celebrated digital products, Magic Apron, was raised. Specifically, the Product Dashboard (see Exhibit 1) reported that Magic Apron was operating at a 65% capability acceptance rate, this is the percentage of capabilities completed per quarter against the target set of capabilities in the product roadmap. This was lower than some of the other vertical groups, so senior leaders were curious as to why capability delivery may be stalling.

The CEO asked Sam, the EVP Digital Products, to explain why execution was breaking down.

**Sam:** My team has been looking into this and we don't think it is an execution problem within our team, we feel it is a coordination problem across vertical teams. Magic Apron is a product that integrates with other products across vertical teams and each group has its own product leaders, roadmaps, and success metrics. That structure helped us scale quickly. But now, the capabilities each product team is developing are colliding when they meet in the customer journey or the store workflow.

**CEO:** So, you think this is a side effect of our success?

**Sam:** Exactly. We decentralized digital innovation to move fast. Now we're seeing the cost of that decentralization. Product leaders optimize for their domain outcomes—engagement, conversion, response, click rate, but there is no single point accountable for how multiple products interact across journeys. If we consolidate product ownership around end-to-end journeys or create a stronger central digital authority—we could reduce overlap and clarify accountability.

**CEO:** I've made it clear that I don't want to go back to uniformity and centralization. This will create a bottleneck that will stifle autonomy, innovation, and speed. Teams are also used to moving fast, so introducing a constraint could also negatively impact morale. However, we are not going to solve for this now. Sam, it is imperative we preserve the gains Magic Apron has delivered to date, this report makes the operational and reputational risks clear. Please explore alternatives to mitigate these risks and report back at our next meeting.

## The Cost of Collisions

While the full cost of capability collisions was difficult to quantify, Home Depot's finance team had begun cataloging the impacts. They identified several categories of concern:

- **Revenue leakage** from declining conversion rates when customers encountered inconsistent experiences across channels
- **Duplicated engineering and infrastructure costs** from teams building parallel capabilities rather than leveraging shared assets
- **Increased customer service volume** tied to fulfillment errors downstream of conflicting recommendations
- **Incident-specific losses** when uncoordinated AI models generated contradictory signals affecting inventory, pricing, or delivery promises

Beyond these direct costs, senior leaders recognized harder-to-measure impacts—erosion of customer trust when the Home Depot experience felt disjointed, associate frustration when store teams couldn't explain what the app or chatbot had promised, and the opportunity cost of leadership attention diverted from growth initiatives to untangling coordination failures. Even conservative estimates suggested the aggregate impact was material enough to warrant urgent attention. Customer feedback told the same story in starker terms (see Exhibit 2).

## Magic Apron Chatbot

At The Home Depot, Magic Apron is managed by the Data Science vertical (see Exhibit 3). It functions as a customer-facing digital intelligence layer that sits across—and depends on—multiple vertical teams to deliver a coherent end-to-end experience. As a chatbot, Magic Apron is designed to defend Home Depot's product authority and elevate customer experience by driving high engagement, response accuracy, and conversion.

However, its performance is tightly coupled to how it integrates with adjacent capabilities:
- It draws on **Search** to surface highly relevant, well-ranked product results
- Aligns with **Recommendations** to translate customer intent into effective next-best actions
- Connects with the **Mobile App** to ensure continuity as customers move across devices
- Must coordinate carefully with **Orange Apron Media**, where sponsored content introduces competing optimization goals around ad revenue
- With the **Pro Experience**, where accuracy, trust, and differentiated capabilities are critical to driving account signups, sales, and share of wallet
- Downstream, its guidance has direct implications for the **delivery line of business** as inaccurate recommendations or incomplete context can cascade into fulfillment errors and customer dissatisfaction

As a result, Magic Apron's success is not determined solely by the VP of Data Science and corresponding product teams. Although the product has its own engagement or accuracy metrics, at the enterprise level its success is determined by how well its decision logic, incentives, and data are aligned with these vertical teams—making it a focal point where capability interactions either reinforce enterprise coherence or expose capability collisions.

## Alex's Perspective: Local Optimization Always Loses to the System

Over the break, Sam ran into his friend Alex at a holiday party. Sam and Alex were in the same MBA class, Alex had since worked his way up to Partner – Digital Transformation and Future Ready Workforce at a well-known consulting firm. Sam shared a bit about what was going on within Home Depot's digital ecosystem. He described how product teams optimized for their own objectives and key results (OKRs), but at the enterprise level capabilities were running into one another. Alex quickly recognized the pattern.

**Alex:** Ah, seems you have a global, local sub-optimization problem. I agree with your CEO, the cause of these capability collisions is not structural—it's managerial. I expect your product teams may lack visibility into enterprise-level dependencies. It's possibly a gap in your product management system, what mechanism are you using to reason across products?

**Sam:** Each product team has a clear mandate, strong metrics, and autonomy. They use a backlog management software to capture epics, stories, tasks, backlogs, and workflows. But we recently invested in Dawg Depot and have a team working on updating our cross-product practices to identify strategic themes and cross-product priorities.

**Alex:** That's a great investment, Dawg Depot is really effective at sequencing work across products and explicit cross-product dependency management—making inter-product dependencies visible and more manageable. The ability to visualize dependencies across products is also great for enhanced capacity and sequencing planning. This should really help your senior team get clarity on how isolated digital products and services work together. However, one thing to think about. If product managers continue to be measured on narrow outcomes, they will naturally focus on local priorities. Without shared outcome metrics, I expect the risk of collisions will still exist. I encourage your senior team to think about how to incentive accountability to end-to-end journeys or system health, not just individual product success.

**Sam:** We do measure redundancy rates at the product level. Our senior team uses this to assess how an individual product has overlapping or redundant goals with other vertical team priorities.

**Alex:** That metric is great for senior leaders as it is an early-warning signal that enterprise coherence may be at risk. A higher redundancy rate suggests that teams are operating with limited visibility into adjacent priorities, shared assets are not being reused, or coordination mechanisms are insufficient. However, it is important your senior team operationalize this metric to shift conversations from anecdotal concerns about "too many tools" or "too many teams doing the same thing" to a more analytical, diagnosable view of where capability collisions are likely to emerge. This metric also doesn't capture how or why redundancy translates into erosion at the system level.

Redundancy does not automatically produce collisions—some duplication can be healthy—and the metric does not reveal whether overlapping capabilities are coordinated, interoperable, or aligned in their decision logic. Nor does it capture dynamic effects such as conflicting incentives, misaligned optimization goals, or declining acceptance of shared capabilities over time. Most importantly, redundancy rates are static snapshots, while capability collisions are interactional and temporal phenomena that emerge through use.

**Sam:** Interesting, I'm sure I'm starting to veer into paid advice now – but anything you can offer an old friend?

**Alex:** Ha, ha. Indeed, you are. Let's just say an investment in AI is a productive avenue to help address the core limitation of treating redundancy rates as a static, product-level signal rather than a dynamic, system-level phenomenon.

## The AI Question: Force Multiplier or Fragmentation Amplifier?

After the holiday, Sam starting working on the CEO's request and reflected back to his conversation with Alex. To date, Sam had framed Home Depot's investment in artificial intelligence (AI) as a force multiplier, meaning AI can accelerate and amplify existing patterns of coordination, decision-making, and capability design. He had shared multiple examples with the senior team about how local product teams were using AI to scale faster, operate more autonomously, and exert greater influence over downstream decisions. Teams operating under pressure were able to take action on differences in assumptions, data definitions, and optimization objectives to deliver speed and performance.

The CEO had not addressed AI specifically, but Sam knew that a key source of capability collisions within Magic Apron were caused by parallel AI models being deployed independently across teams without shared visibility or governance and trained on different data sources. He had a number of real examples of this overlap was generating conflicting recommendations to the same customer, embedding inconsistent business rules into workflows, or pulling operational processes in opposing directions. He came up with the idea to frame AI as a fragmentation amplifier to explain how AI-driven collisions were especially dangerous as they are less visible and harder to unwind than traditional coordination failures. He wrote down the following words of caution to share with the senior team:

- Even with portfolio-level planning and shared governance, teams may not even be aware that their AI systems are interacting, much less undermining one another.
- Over time, these interactions can erode enterprise coherence resulting in increased hidden costs and new operational and reputational risks that were difficult to see—or manage—through traditional governance mechanisms.
- As trust in shared capabilities declines, redundancy increases as teams build local alternatives and leadership loses confidence in the organization's ability to explain or control how decisions are being made.

In this sense, AI does not necessary create new redundancy, it multiplies the speed, scale, and impact of redundancy, making coordination, transparency, and governance essential not to slow innovation, but to ensure that AI-powered capabilities reinforce—rather than fracture—the enterprise as a whole.

Reflecting back on his conversation with Alex, he wondered whether the source of the problem may also be a key enabler of the solution. More specifically, he wondered how AI may help transform the treatment of redundancy rates as a static, product-level signal to a dynamic, system-level phenomenon. He imagined an AI-powered "coherence layer" that could continuously monitor interactions between products—flagging when recommendation logic from one team conflicted with optimization rules from another before the collision reached customers, or alerting product owners when parallel AI models were being trained on divergent data sources.

## Joanna's Perspective: Portfolio is not a Connective Tissue

Sam recalled a recent presentation Joanna, the Senior Leader for Enterprise Management, made to the digital product and IT teams. She shared a business case and proof of concept about how an investment in Dawg Depot's AI agent (Rover) integrated with Dawg Depot Dashboard may help with information synthesis and searching across product teams, but also help to organize work across a variety of data platforms. He recalled a number of questions raised by the IT team about how Rover might integrate with Dawg Document, the product used by the IT team to manage enterprise architecture diagrams, data sources, decision records, and AI model assumptions. As Joanna had not looked into the integration with Dawg Document, she agreed to look into this and report back.

**Sam:** Hey Joanna. Any chance you've made any progress looking into the Rover-Dawg Document integration?

**Joanna:** I have, but I really think it is out of scope. The purpose of Rover would be to make product integration more dynamic, shared user journeys, consistent interfaces, or coordinated feature roadmaps. Data and architecture integration, by contrast, operate below the product layer, this is more like building a connective tissue that shapes how information flows, how technical decisions are made, and how algorithmic logic is executed across the enterprise. These integrations involve aligning data definitions, ontologies, pipelines, decision rules, and system dependencies—often across capabilities that were never designed to interact directly.

**Sam:** Do you know if Dawg Document has an AI enhancement?

**Joanna:** I did look into it, but admittedly I'm not too familiar with Dawg Document. My understanding is that Dawg Document is augmenting their product with AI, meaning that they are more focused on developing ways to help their users condition AI models to reduce hallucination risk, improve relevance, and increase trust by anchoring AI outputs in documented decisions and shared understanding. I didn't find anything on their website that suggested a solution for helping IT teams manage architecture and data integration.

**Sam:** I'm not surprised, our IT organization invested heavily in integrated, enterprise architecture practices long before the current wave of digital products and AI-enabled capabilities.

**Joanna:** Yes, I thought about that too but I wonder if our existing enterprise architecture capability is fully aligned with modern conceptions of enterprise coherence. The CEO is adamant that coherence does not imply uniformity or centralized control. This may require a shift in the role of enterprise architecture from primarily designing stable structures and standards to actively support evolving interactions among capabilities—many of which are developed and optimized outside of IT's direct control.

**Sam:** That is a really good point. So, the challenge is not whether Home Depot has a strong enterprise architecture function—it clearly does—but whether that function is positioned to operate as a coordination capability with our product organization. This was really helpful, thank you Joanna.

## Next Senior Leadership Team Meeting

At the next senior leadership team meeting, Sam reassured the CEO that Home Depot's transformation into a large-scale digital product organization had empowered teams to deliver leading edge digital and AI-enabled products and that the current operating model—organized around domains with clear ownership, roadmaps, and metrics—was instrumental in driving speed and innovation. However, as these capabilities scaled and become increasingly AI-enabled, friction is growing where multiple products interact and there is significant risk or erosion of enterprise coherence.

**Sam:** What I learned is that our decentralized model enables us to move fast, but we have not fully evolved our coordination mechanisms to match the complexity we've created. Our deliberate investment in Depot Dashboard was a productive first step, we now have a way to make cross-product priorities, dependencies, and sequencing visible at the portfolio level—linking team-level execution to strategic themes and enterprise outcomes. I'm confident this will enable senior leaders to better understand how individual products contributed to shared initiatives, identify points of overlap or dependency earlier, and coordinate investment decisions without reverting to centralized control.

However, the investment also surfaced important challenges.

However, while Depot Dashboard is effective at planning and sequencing work, it does not, on its own, change the incentive structures that drive local optimization, nor does it resolve deeper data, architectural, or AI-level interactions between capabilities. For example, metrics like redundancy rates are valuable early-warning signals, but they remain static and insufficient to explain how or why overlap becomes harmful at the system level. It is also important to highlight that many product teams are making AI enhancements and deploying them independently, this is amplifying misalignments. I believe this is what explains some of the concerns we have about Magic Apron that we discussed at our last meeting.

So, I'm afraid I wasn't able to narrow in on a set of alternatives to mitigate risk, but I do think we need to recognize that without complementary changes to shared outcome metrics, governance, and architectural coordination, there is a risk that Depot Dashboard becomes a sophisticated planning overlay—improving visibility but stopping short of addressing the underlying conditions that allow capability collisions to persist.

So, my recommendation is that we develop a strategy for how we can reduce customer friction in shared domains in a way that does not move us backward by reinstating uniformity or centralization. We also need to be careful that we don't add significant administrative burden, our teams already waste too much time in meetings.

After a short discussion, the CEO and other senior team leaders agreed with this approach. They asked Sam to focus the strategy development specifically on Magic Apron and asked that the strategy clearly explain why capabilities are colliding as well as provide some insight into the financial implications of future collisions if this gap is not addressed. Once they had a viable strategy for Magic Apron, they would feel more confident to roll it out to other Home Depot products. The CEO added, "I don't need a hundred-page report. I need a clear point of view on where we should intervene, why, and what it will take. If the logic holds, we'll fund a deeper dive."

## Dave's Perspective: The Cost of Colliding Ownership

As a starting point to strategy development, Sam reviewed the 2026 integrated roadmap for Magic Apron (Exhibit 4). Although he had discussed the 65% capability acceptance rate with leaders of his product teams, he knew he was missing something. He sent a meeting request to Dave, the VP Delivery, in hopes that a leader from the business may offer a novel and unique perspective.

**Sam:** Dave, I was looking at the Dawg Depot dashboard for Magic Apron. At the highest level, the plan looks clear and the portfolio looks healthy - funding is mapped to key initiatives and OKRs are set. But on the ground, I'm hearing that velocity is stalling. Also, senior leaders are inquiring why some of our capability rates are low. I see your vertical is reporting at 60%, do you have any ideas about where the disconnect is?

**Dave:** There's a governance gap that exists at lower levels of execution, but doesn't materialize in a high-level view of the plan. At the top, we have a clear set of goals and strategies to achieve them; at the bottom, the teams have autonomy to pursue their goals set their own priorities. But in the middle - where capabilities overlap – this is where ownership and work collide. My Product Recommendations team deals with this all the time. They're responsible for relevance and effectiveness of recommendations containers on our website, but are regularly faced with justifying their experience approach and priorities to other teams with conflicting goals and incentives.

**Sam:** What situation would require that kind of justification? Don't they own recommendations across the site?

**Dave:** Think of the Sponsored Product Ads team. Their OKR is ad revenue. They're incentivized to put a paid placement in the most visible spot. Last week, we had an issue on the product detail page where a new paid placement bumped a high-performing recommendations container below the fold. Now, these ads carry a lot of business value, but we're potentially making customer experience tradeoffs without full visibility or alignment to the implications. We haven't defined who owns the priority of that page.

**Sam:** So, we're competing against ourselves for the same screen space.

**Dave:** Exactly. Speaking of competing with ourselves – we are also having a lot of issues with the interaction between our Recs products with the new gen AI-enabled Magic Apron chatbot. The team behind this is building a slew of capabilities to augment their chat experience, one of which is to provide relevant product recommendations. As a logical first step, the Magic Apron team began building on top of what Recs already offered. However, these teams aren't operationally tied, so Magic Apron has begun building a "Recs lite" engine to maintain velocity, while the Recs team is working on features that Magic Apron doesn't know about or easily benefit from.

**Sam:** Seems like less of a conflict compared to Sponsored Products, more of a failure to optimize an experience between two products that could be working together.

**Dave:** That's right. And since we're talking about chat interfaces, I'll give you a final example that highlights a third, common type of friction. We have a legacy team managing the "Human Agent" chat for the Contact Center, which is on a completely different tech stack from the Magic Apron chatbot. The teams are in a stalemate over whose stack survives, and since their OKRs don't overlap, no one is incentivized to blink first. This delays critical work that will greatly enhance our online customer experience – a chat interface that seamlessly blends machine intelligence with the need for human assistance – while in the interim we maintain two systems that don't do each other's job well.

**Sam:** (Sighs) I see the pattern. We've optimized for product autonomy so much that we've lost system harmony. We've given everyone a compass, but no one is using the same map.

**Dave:** Yes, I think so. We don't have a delivery problem, but rather an interface problem with our software and our org chart.

## Maria's Perspective: The View from the Aisle

Before finalizing his thoughts, Sam visited a local store to meet with Maria, a veteran Store Manager who had seen every iteration of Home Depot's digital transformation. While senior leaders analyzed capability acceptance rates and technical architecture, Maria was focused on how these tools performed in the hands of customers and associates on the floor. She explained that while the digital products were individually impressive, the lack of coordination was creating a new kind of "Orange Apron" fatigue.

Sam and Maria walked past a display of smart home devices as she described the day-to-day reality of managing these digital tools.

**Sam:** The dashboards back at the SSC show high engagement with the Magic Apron chatbot, but the NPS verbatims are starting to tell a different story. From where you stand, what's the actual experience?

**Maria:** Sam, it's like we've given my associates five different high-tech tools, but each tool thinks it's the only one in the store. Just this morning, a DIYer came in with a project list the chatbot had generated for a deck refresh. It looked great on his phone, but when we got to the bay, two of the stains were out of stock. The chatbot told him they were on the shelf, but my inventory system knew they were gone.

**Sam:** So, the bot and the inventory engine aren't synchronized in real-time?

**Maria:** Not even close. And it's more than just stock levels. While I was trying to find him a substitute, a sponsored ad popped up on his app for a completely different brand of stain—one that wasn't even on his original list. He looked at me and asked, "Which one of these is actually the expert?" When our digital tools give conflicting advice, my associates look like they don't know their own products. He ended up leaving for Lowe's because he lost trust in our expert opinion.

**Sam:** It sounds like we're optimizing the individual features—the bot, the ads, the app—but we're breaking the customer's trust in the process.

**Maria:** Exactly. We don't need more features that work in a vacuum. We need them to talk to each other so my team isn't spent apologizing for a digital promise the store can't keep. My people are tired of untangling the digital noise just to make a sale.

Maria concluded that while the organization had successfully given everyone a digital compass, the associates and customers were still waiting for a single, unified map to navigate their projects.

## Moving Forward

As Sam reflected on the conversations with the Alex, Joanna, Dave, and Maria it became clear that capabilities running into one another were indeed an urgent and costly phenomenon at Home Depot. Digital products were colliding not because teams were careless or incompetent, but because the organization had outpaced its ability to coordinate, see, and reason about an increasingly complex digital ecosystem. Yet, beneath these technology, data, and workflow collisions was a parallel challenge, vertical teams accountable for their own domains, making rational decisions through different lenses—growth, efficiency, customer experience, risk—without a shared system-level frame. In this sense, capability collisions may actually be symptoms of a deeper issue: fragmented leadership sensemaking in a product- and AI-driven enterprise.

With only two weeks remaining, Sam knew he needed to prepare something that reached beyond surface-level fixes. His recommendation would need to justify where the organization should intervene and why. He also knew AI had to be part of the recommended solution.

Sam jotted down the names of his dream team. He included a cross-section of leaders who would examine the root cause of capability collisions from multiple perspectives to ensure that strategy provided a clear explanation for why capabilities are colliding. Next was Home Depot's top AI expert based on the advice he received from Alex, this person would be critical to ensure the recommendation offered a way to transform redundancy rates into a dynamic, system-level phenomenon. Next, he added a person who was experienced at developing a comprehensive recommendation and cost model as he knew he would need to justify the potential spend to the senior team. Last, he added one of Home Depot's best financial analysts as he hoped the cost-benefit analysis would include a prediction of financial implications caused by future collisions if this gap is not addressed.

## Case Assignment – Team Deliverables

Each team will act as Sam's task force and prepare a strategic recommendation for Home Depot's Senior Leadership Team. Your deliverable should include the following components:

### 1. Identify Key Issues, Stakeholders, and Underlying Drivers
Provide a clear explanation of why capabilities are colliding at Home Depot. Your analysis should go beyond surface-level symptoms to identify the underlying organizational, technical, and governance factors contributing to friction across vertical teams.

### 2. Strategic Recommendation
Propose a solution that reduces customer friction in shared domains while preserving the speed, autonomy, and innovation that Home Depot's decentralized model enables. Your recommendation must address how AI can transform redundancy rates from a static, product-level signal into a dynamic, system-level coordination mechanism. Be specific about governance changes, shared metrics, and coordination mechanisms you would implement.

### 3. Financial Analysis
Develop a cost-benefit model that quantifies the investment required to implement your recommendation and the expected return. Include a projection of the financial implications of continued capability collisions if the gap is not addressed—consider hidden costs, operational risks, and potential reputational damage.

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
Outline a phased approach for piloting your recommendation with Magic Apron before scaling across other Home Depot products. Identify key milestones, success metrics, and decision gates.

**Presentation Format:** Teams will present their recommendations in a 20-minute presentation to a judging panel, followed by 10 minutes of Q&A.

**Judging Criteria:**
1. Depth of root cause analysis
2. Strategic creativity and coherence of recommendations
3. Feasibility of implementation roadmap
4. Rigor of financial justification
