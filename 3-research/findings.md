## 6. Team Topologies Framework (Applicable to Case)

### Core Concepts for Capability Collision Problem

| Team Type | Role | HD Application |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Stream-aligned** | End-to-end product ownership | Magic Apron, Recommendations, Search, etc. |
| **Platform** | Shared capabilities, reduces cognitive load | Proposed "Event Streaming Layer" |
| **Enabling** | Helps teams adopt new practices | Governance/architecture teams |
| **Complicated-subsystem** | Deep specialization | Inventory system, Pricing engine |

### Interaction Modes

| Mode | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Collaboration** | High-bandwidth, high-cost joint work | Building new shared capabilities |
| **X-as-a-Service** | Clear boundaries, low coordination | Steady-state platform consumption |
| **Facilitating** | Temporary help removing obstacles | Onboarding teams to new patterns |

**Key Insight:** Platform teams should aim for **X-as-a-Service** as default mode (low coordination overhead) while using **Collaboration** mode only when developing new capabilities.

**Case Application:** HD's collision problem = too much implicit collaboration without explicit interfaces. Solution = create explicit platform (event stream) with X-as-a-Service consumption model.

## 7. Competitive Positioning Summary

| Dimension | Home Depot | Lowe's |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **AI Partner** | Google Cloud (Gemini) | OpenAI (ChatGPT) |
| **AI Launch** | Magic Apron (Mar 6) | Mylow (Mar 5) |
| **NPS** | 43 (above avg) | 29 (below avg) |
| **J.D. Power** | 641 (#4) | 680 (#1) |
| **Online Sales** | ~$21B | ~$12B (projected) |
| **AI Scale** | 175+ use cases | 100B tokens with OpenAI |
| **Pro Focus** | Heavy (SRS acquisition, B2B) | Moderate |

## 8. Amazon Two-Pizza Teams Model

### Organizational Philosophy

Amazon's "two-pizza teams" (2PTs) represent an extreme divisional organization:
- **Size:** 6-10 people (small enough to feed with two pizzas)
- **Autonomy:** Teams are free to execute relatively autonomously to maximize their "fitness function"
- **Structure:** Engineers, technical PMs, designers report directly to 2PT lead
- **Coordination:** "No need to coordinate even across teams, let alone across divisions, to get something done"

**Source:** [Jason Crawford](https://jasoncrawford.org/two-pizza-teams), [AWS Executive Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/amazon-two-pizza-team/)

### Governance Model

Amazon uses **"guardrails" rather than "tollgates"**:
- Guardrails = mechanisms that allow teams to run fast while making high-quality decisions
- Tollgates = approval gates that impede speed

**Case Relevance:** HD's challenge is similar — how to provide guardrails (visibility, shared data) without tollgates (centralized approval).

## 9. Walmart Omnichannel Organization

### Strategic Identity

CEO Doug McMillon's framing: **"People-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer"**

- Put impactful technology to work to strengthen customer experience

- Focus: "Drive innovations that impact millions of lives globally"

**Source:** [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html)

### AI Operating Framework

Walmart uses **"Eliminate, Automate, Optimize"** framework:
1. **Eliminate** — Check if process is even necessary before automating
2. **Automate** — Apply AI to essential but repetitive tasks
3. **Optimize** — Continuous improvement

**Example:** Invoice processing automation freed hundreds of employees for higher-value work.

### Cost Efficiency Target

- **~20% reduction in fulfillment costs** through supply chain/automation initiatives

## 10. McKinsey AI Governance Framework (2024-2025)

### Current State of AI Governance

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **AI Adoption** | 88%+ of organizations use AI in at least one function |

**Source:** [McKinsey - Elevating Board Governance](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-technology/our-insights/the-ai-reckoning-how-boards-can-evolve)

### McKinsey Recommendations

1. **Define decision tiers:**
   - Full board: Material investments to scale enterprise-wide AI
   - Committee: Risk frameworks, vendor reviews
   - No board discussion: Operational decisions

2. **Quantify trade-offs:** Management should quantify (not just identify) AI opportunities AND risks

3. **Govern for safety AND speed:**
   - Establish approvals matrix by risk tier
   - Pre-approve tools/datasets
   - Log prompts and outputs
   - Define rollback procedures

**Source:** [McKinsey State of AI 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)

### Agentic AI Governance

For organizations with AI agents:
> "Governance cannot remain a periodic, paper-heavy exercise. As agents operate continuously, governance must become **real-time, data-driven, and embedded** — with humans holding final accountability."

**Source:** [McKinsey - Agentic AI Security](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/deploying-agentic-ai-with-safety-and-security-a-playbook-for-technology-leaders)

### Risk Mitigation Trends
